In this practice set, you'll build on the concepts you learned in this pathway by creating a Superheroes app. This app focuses on creating the components necessary to build a scrollable list and a polished UI using the Material Design principles you learned in Material Theming with Jetpack Compose codelab.

The solution code is available at the end, but try to solve the exercises before you check it. Consider the solutions as one way to implement the app. There's a lot of room for improvement, so feel free to experiment and try different things.

Work through the problems at a pace that's comfortable to you. You're encouraged to take as much time as you need to solve each problem thoughtfully.
